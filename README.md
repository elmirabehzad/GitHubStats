# GitHubStats
In this project we're going to have an example of ASP.Net Web Api that is actually a webservice to offer Git Hub Api facilities.

This Project has tow parts:

1) WEB API
  ASP.Net MVC4 C#
  
2) Web Site
  Extjs
  
Installation:

For deploying WEB API use it with an web service (IIS).
For deploying WebSite (ExtJS) it is in GitHubStats/GitHubStats/Dashboard just running index.html.
Dasboard folder must be in root path of the web api in web server, because at the moment web site (Dashboard) is not cross domain and maybe in future we use feture of JsonP to make it Cross Domain in which you can deploy Dashboard on every domain.
